# StockExchange API Project
Welcome to the **Stock Exchange API Project**! This comprehensive system is designed to provide a seamless and efficient platform for managing stock exchange operations. The project is divided into five main components: **API Gateway**, **Accounts**, **Analyzer**, **Stock API**, and **Settlement**.

## Components

### 1. API Gateway
The **API Gateway** serves as the central entry point for all interactions with the stock exchange system. It efficiently routes requests to the appropriate services, ensuring a unified and streamlined experience for developers and users.

### 2. Accounts
The **Accounts** component is responsible for managing user accounts and authentication. It provides a secure and scalable solution for user registration, login, and account management, ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of user data.

### 3. Analyzer
The **Analyzer** module is a powerful tool for market analysis. It leverages advanced algorithms to process and interpret stock market data, providing valuable insights and trends. Users can make informed decisions based on the **Analyzer's** comprehensive analysis reports.

### 4. Stock API
The **Stock API** is the heart of the system, offering a set of endpoints to access real-time stock market data. This component integrates with external financial data sources to provide accurate and up-to-date information on stock prices, trading volumes, and more.

### 5. Settlement
The **Settlement** component handles the critical task of settling trades and transactions. It ensures the accurate and timely processing of financial transactions, maintaining the integrity of the stock exchange system and facilitating a smooth trading experience for users.
